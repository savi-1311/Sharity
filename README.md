#Sharity - The Best Christmas Smile you can Gift

## 💡Inspiration
* ☃️ Winter is a season of🎄 Holidays and Gifts! But the case is drastically different for the underprivileged section of society. According to the statistics, nearly 4.8 million deaths are caused due to extreme cold. Many people don't even have proper warm clothes to protect them from the frostbiting cold.

* 🧣 On the other hand, we generally look for new styles and fashionable sweaters, jackets even boots every year. And in turn, discard the old clothes which can be used by the needy.

* 🌱 Nowadays, we don't find pure woollen garments easily. Instead, they are mixed with synthetic fibres. On throwing it away, the entire thing will take forever to biodegrade. Hence, just throwing away the garments is harmful to nature as well.

## ⚙️ What it does?
Sharity is a web platform where you can upload and donate your used and discarded winter wears for the underprivileged. Either you will be contacted by Donation Centres or somebody in need of the items.

### Features:
